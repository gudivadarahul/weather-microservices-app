# Weather App Microservices

## Project Overview

The Weather App Microservices project is designed to deploy a weather application using a microservices architecture on AWS ECS with Docker. This project includes several services, including a Weather Data Service, a Basic Alert Service, and a frontend interface. The services interact with various AWS components like API Gateway, S3, SNS, and CloudWatch to provide real-time weather data, alerts, and user interfaces.

## Architecture

### Microservices

- **Weather Data Service**: Fetches weather data from the National Weather Service (NWS) API and provides it via a RESTful API.
- **Basic Alert Service**: Monitors weather data and sends notifications via Amazon SNS based on predefined conditions.
- **API Gateway**: Manages and routes requests to the appropriate microservice, handling integration with ECS services.

### AWS Services

- **ECS**: Manages Docker containers with Fargate for serverless container management.
- **S3**: Hosts static assets for the frontend.
- **SNS**: Sends notifications via email or SMS.
- **CloudWatch**: Monitors and logs ECS tasks.

### External Integration

- **National Weather Service API**: Used for fetching weather data.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- AWS Account with appropriate permissions.
- AWS CLI installed and configured.
- Docker installed on your local machine.
- Python 3.x for backend development.
- Node.js for frontend development.

### Environment Setup

1. **AWS Setup**:

   - Create IAM users and groups with necessary permissions.
   - Set up VPC, subnets, and security groups.

2. **ECS Setup**:

   - Create an ECS cluster using Fargate.
   - Define and deploy the task definitions for Weather Data Service and Alert Service.

3. **ECR Setup**:

   - Create ECR repositories for each microservice.

4. **Frontend Setup**:
   - Create a React application and configure it to interact with the backend API.

### Service Deployment

1. **Deploy Weather Data Service**:

   - Build and push Docker images to ECR.
   - Deploy the service using ECS and configure networking.

2. **Deploy Basic Alert Service**:

   - Similarly, build and push Docker images and deploy the service.

3. **Frontend Deployment**:

   - Build the frontend and host it on S3.

4. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Set up AWS CodePipeline to automate builds and deployments.

## Usage

- **Accessing the Frontend**:

  - The frontend is hosted on S3 and accessible via a public URL.

- **Interacting with the API**:

  - Use the API Gateway to route requests to the appropriate microservice.
  - Example: `http://<api-gateway-url>/api/weather?lat=38.8894&lon=-77.0352`

- **Monitoring and Alerts**:
  - CloudWatch for logs and monitoring.
  - SNS for alerts.

## Configuration

- **API Gateway Configuration**: Configure the API Gateway to route requests to the correct microservice.
- **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables to manage configurations for different environments (development, staging, production).
- **Docker Configuration**: Include configurations for Docker containers, such as exposed ports, environment variables, and volumes.

## Documentation for Microservices Architecture

### Service Overview

- **Weather Data Service**: Handles fetching and processing of weather data from external APIs.
- **Basic Alert Service**: Monitors weather data and sends out notifications.
- **API Gateway**: Acts as a single entry point for client requests and routes them to the appropriate microservice.

### API Documentation

- **Weather Data Service**:
  - **Endpoint**: `/api/weather`
  - **Method**: `GET`
  - **Parameters**: `lat` (latitude), `lon` (longitude)
  - **Response**: JSON object containing weather data (temperature, forecast, etc.)
  - **Example Call**:
    ```bash
    curl "http://localhost:5000/api/weather?lat=38.8894&lon=-77.0352"
    ```
